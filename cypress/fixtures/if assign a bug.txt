If I assign a bug to developer, I always make sure that it's a real bug so I mean I check that if the requirements are clear and I understand it clearly and also I ask for my colleague to review it. For doing that I use a way that I ask for my colleague to review it.
After developer denied the bug, I would show him/her my point of view to explain why I'm thinking it's a bug, than ask show me your point of view, I try to understand his thinking about the bug
If conflict continue then I ask for PO to clarify the story and wait the response.

How do you run your regression? (3 min)
First of all I'm using java and bdd cucumber framework, maven also as a build automation tool. Jenkins is my CI-CD tool.

I run my regression suit via Jenkins by using AWS server.
